Abstract
-----------

The paper studies existence, uniqueness and stability of stationary
equilibrium distributions in a class of stochastic dynamic models common to
economic analysis.  We provide applications to a heterogeneous agent model and
two nonlinear multisector time series models with unbounded state space.
